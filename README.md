## Goal:
The goal of this LCA is to evaluate and quantify the environmental impacts associated with the life cycle of a refrigerator over its 15-year operational lifetime. The assessment covers material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, usage, and end-of-life disposal, aiming to provide a detailed understanding of the refrigerator's environmental footprint within defined system boundaries.

## Objective:
The objective is to create a detailed Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) that quantifies all materials, energy inputs, and outputs associated with the refrigerator's 15-year life cycle. This includes analyzing the environmental impacts of materials such as steel, plastics, refrigerants, and energy consumption during use. The study is designed to identify opportunities for product design improvements, enhanced sustainability, and reduced environmental impacts.

## Methodology:
This LCA was conducted using a detailed Excel-based analysis. The process involved:

- Material Assessment: Compile a comprehensive inventory of refrigerator materials, including steel, aluminum, plastics, and refrigerants, and document their respective quantities and uses.
- Data Compilation: Integrating manufacturing processes (e.g., cold-rolled steel, injection molding), transportation distances (e.g., ocean freight, rail, and truck), and disposal pathways (e.g., landfill).
- Operational Analysis: This evaluates energy consumption during the refrigerator's use phase (613.2 kWh/year over 15 years).
- Documentation: Recording assumptions, data sources, and calculation methods within the Excel workbook to ensure transparency and repeatability.
  
This structured approach allowed for a detailed evaluation of the refrigeratorâ€™s life cycle impacts, facilitating data-driven recommendations for sustainability improvements.
